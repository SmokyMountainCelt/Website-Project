<h1 style="background-color:Gold;"<h1>Mission Statement And History</h1>
<i><p style="background-color:Gold;"
<p>This page has been dedicated to uncovering the reasons why Chuck Norris is so loved by modern society. We will dive deep into the origin and life of this legend and find out if the obcession of Mr. Norris is worth the excitement that guides conversations surrounding him. We will also explore possible ways to achieve Chuck-like powers.</p>
<p style="background-color:Gold;"
<p> According to Wikipedia at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris/">Chuck Norris</a> the man himself appeared in our mortal plane as Carlos Ray Norris on March 10, 1940 in Ryan, Oklahoma. It is my belief that Mr. Norris chose to appear there in our world because only a few hundred people live there and it's very easy for someone to cross into our dimension out in the country in the middle of the night without being noticed. As stated by his human caretakers ("parents"), when interviewed by no one (this interview was fabricated for this webpage), they liken the experience to a miniature supernova, both beautiful, yet destructive.</p>

<p> Many great feats have been attributed to Mr. Norris. For example, Chuck can hear sign language. I don't know of one human that can do that. How can we, as lowly mortals in this barren wasteland of our existence, even begin to imagine the supreme powers that are contained in his 5 ft. 10 in. (178 cm) frame? How can any human count to infinity, not once, but twice? At one point, Chuck Norris tried to open a restaurant to have something to do, but it didn't work out because he would make onions cry. Natural objects and elements are affected differently when they encounter him. Also think about the effect on our planet and in nature. One time, Chuck Norris decided to go horseback riding. The horse would not obey, no matter how much he tried to handle thinga in a civil fashion, but to no effect. Therefore, in a fit of light rage, Chuck Norris dismounted said equine creature, then proceded to punch the horse upwards under the jaw line, creating a new species of creature that we now refer to as a giraffe (Girraffa Chuckus Uppercutus).</p>

<p> There are things that Chuck Norris can do, abilities he has, that are still unexplained to modern science. Psychologists are not able to perform a good assessment on him due to him being able to refer to himself in the fourth person. He can rub two pieces of fire together to make wood. He is the only known being in existence that can kick someone in the back of the face. For even more information about who I'm sure is actually a deity, feel free to check out the link provided at the end of this paragraph. </p>
